# FAME is Free and Open Source

And we intend to keep it that way. By opening FAME, our goal is to turn it into a self-sustainable project, where not only the core developers but **the whole community** helps out when the community needs help. We believe that communication is better handled centrally and this is why we will be relying on **GitHub issues for all communication**.

### Developers

* Create modules and share them with the community by creating pull requests on the [fame_modules](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/fame_modules) repository. You can also keep your modules on you own GitHub repository. If you do, please tell us so that we can spread the word.
* Send core [pull-requests](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/fame/pulls) our way!
* If you have any question, do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/fame/issues).

### Users

Even if you don't code, you can also help us by:

* Telling us how you're using FAME, we can always think of new features to add when we see different use-cases.
* If you find something that doesn't work, tell the world by [opening an issue](https://github.com/certsocietegenerale/fame/issues).
* When doing so, try to be as clear as possible and answer all the questions in the issue template.
